As of 2019-5-29, only iThemer can accomplish this. Please don't ask about other engines.</li><li>Included as well are images for SafariPlus Downloads button. You can copy/move them to /Library/Application Support/SafariPlus.bundle and replace the images there (back them up first)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nLastly, this is free. Donations are always welcome though if you find that you like my work.\r\n\r\n Credit for them goes to bqlqn from flaticon.",
